# C++ Modules from Hive Helsinki (42 Network)

This repo contains my solutions to all the C++ modules that are part of the 42 network curriculum. Each module focuses on a specific set of core C++ concepts, serving as an introduction to many essential features of object-oriented programming.

All modules have been passed with full marks and all but one modules have been passed on the first attempt:

## Modules

- **Module 00:** Basics of C++ sytnax and the concept of classes, and helped move beyond a C-style approach to string manipulation.
- **Module 01:** Memory allocation, references, pointers to members.
- **Module 02:** Learn ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and implement the orhtodox canonical form (default constructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator, destructor).
- **Module 03:** Dove into inheritance, base and derived classes, protected class members.
- **Module 04:** Polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces to build extendible class hierarchies.
- **Module 05:** Explore exception handling with try/catch blocks, throw expressions, and defining custom exception types depending on the needs.
- **Module 06:** Examine the various C++ casts (static_cast, dynamic_cast, reinterpret_cast, const_cast) and their appropriate usecases.
- **Module 07:** aearning about templates in C++, including function templates, class templates, and template specialization.
- **Module 08:** Starting this module, we were allowed to use STL. So I was able to get familiarized with containers, iterators, and algorithms.
- **Module 09:** Full-blown use of STL containers, iterators, and algorithms to implement tasks like complex string parsing and data sorting.
